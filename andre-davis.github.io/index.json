Add a short description Check the box to \u0026quot;Initialize this repository with a README. Click Create Repository  Once the repository has been created, Click on Clone or download and copy the “Clone with HTTPS” link provided. You’ll use this to clone your repo in RStudio Cloud.\nNote: If you’re stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: Version Control. Refer to the materials in this course if you’re stuck on this part of the project.\n RStudio Cloud Setup Go to RStudio Coud and create a new project based on Github. As discussed previously, you’ll want all your data science projects to be organized from the very beginning. Let’s do that now!\nFirst, use cd to get yourself into the directory of your GitHub Project.\nOnce in the correct directory, use mkdir in the terminal to create folders with the following structure:\n data/  raw_data/ tidy_data/  code/  raw_code/ final_code/  figures/  exploratory_figures/ explanatory_figures/  products/  writing/   Upload the data file into the tidy_data folder and this .Rmd file into the main project directory.\nOnce the .Rmd document is in the correct folder, you’ll want to change the author of this document to your name at the top of the .Rmd document (in the YAML). Save this change before moving to the next step.\nNote: If you’re stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: Organizing Data Science Projects. Refer to the materials in this course if you’re stuck on this part of the project.\n Pushing to GitHub You’ll want to save changes to your project regularly by pushing them to GitHub. Now that you’ve got your file structure set up and have added a code file (.Rmd), it’s a good time to stage, commit, and push these changes to GitHub. Do so now, and then take a long on GitHub to see the changes on their website!\nNote: If you’re stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: Version Control. Refer to the materials in this course if you’re stuck on this part of the project.\n The data Video gaming has a long history as far back as the early 1950s but it did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s when video arcade games and gaming consoles were introduced to the general public. Since the 1980s, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern culture in most parts of the world. However, the industry also experienced its first major growing pains in early 1980s as publishing houses appeared and competition became intense.\nThe purpose of this project is to explore the development of the video game industry from 1980-2017, and find market opportunities that industry newcomers may be interested in. Our analysis will focus on publishers, game genres and the popularity of genres by region.\nLoad the data into a data frame called gaming.

You have completed the project. There are a few final notes:\n Add Markdown Text to .Rmd Before finalizing your project you’ll want be sure there are comments in your code chunks and text outside of your code chunks to explain what you’re doing in each code chunk. These explanations are incredibly helpful for someone who doesn’t code or someone unfamiliar to your project.\nNote: If you’re stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: Introduction to R. Refer to the R Markdown lesson in this course if you’re stuck on this part (or the next part) of the project.\n Knit your R Markdown Document Last but not least, you’ll want to Knit your .Rmd document into an HTML document. If you get an error, take a look at what the error says and edit your .Rmd document. Then, try to Knit again! Troubleshooting these error messages will teach you a lot about coding in R.\n A Few Final Checks A complete project should have:\n Completed code chunks throughout the .Rmd document (your RMarkdown document should Knit without any error) README.md text file explaining your project Comments in your code chunks Answered all questions throughout this exercise.   Final push to GitHub Now that you’ve finalized your project, you’ll do one final push to GitHub. add, commit, and push your work to GitHub. Navigate to your GitHub repository, and answer the final question below!\nNote: If you’re stuck on this, these steps were covered in detail in an earlier course: Version Control. Refer to the materials in this course if you’re stuck on this part of the project.\nAt the end, submit the link to your github repository to us.\nSubmit the URL to your final_project GitHub repository below.\n  ","date":1556928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556928000,"objectID":"3c74ef8e8b7332fd10c1875d7ea3f6ff","permalink":"/project/gaming-through-the-years/","publishdate":"2019-05-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gaming-through-the-years/","section":"project","summary":"Note: If you try to Knit this document at this time, you will get an error because there is code in this document that has to be edited (by you!) before it will be able to successfully knit!\nFinal Project This exercise has been generated to practice everything you have learned in this course set.\nGitHub Setup To get started, you’ll want to go to GitHub and start a new repository:","tags":["R"],"title":"Gaming through the years","type":"project"},{"authors":["Andre Davis"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.
